<header>Bioinformatic scripts used for the study Disentangling the worldwide invasion process of Halyomorpha halys through ABC.</header></br></br>
R scripts used for exploratory analyses (DAPC,kmeans and Fst) are in the folder genetic_analyses.</br></br>
In the folder simulations, divided per steps and models, you can find the input files used for fastsimcoal simulations and the R scripts used to infer segregatin, fixed and opposite sites for simulated data (compute_sites.R), while in simulations/observed_sites the are the R scrimpts used to compute sites from the observed data.</br></br>
In the folder Model_selection there are the R scripts used to perform the ABC-RF analysis for each step.</br></br>
The script parameter_estimation.r is used for the ABC-RF parameter estimation analysis.</br></br>
